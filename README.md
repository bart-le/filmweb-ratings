This is a web scraper built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/ "Node.js") and [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v2.1.1&show=api-overview "Puppeteer") which saves user's rated movies from [Filmweb](https://www.filmweb.pl/ "Filmweb") in a JSON file and prints its content to the console. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ "Download Node.js") before running if you haven't already.

Once installed type **`node -v`** in your terminal. This should print out the version you've installed.

```
$ node -v
v12.16.1
```

* Install the rest of the dependencies with **`npm install`**.

* Enter **`cd src && node index.js usernameOrEmail password`** in order to run the scraper.
